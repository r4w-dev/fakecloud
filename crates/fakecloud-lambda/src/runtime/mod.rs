//! Lambda execution runtime — pluggable backend behind a shared facade.

//! [`LambdaRuntime`] owns the warm-pool bookkeeping and the HTTP

//! discovery, teardown) is delegated to whatever [`LambdaBackend`] the
//! facade was constructed with — today that's [`DockerBackend`]; a
//! Kubernetes backend ships in a follow-up.
